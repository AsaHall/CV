          <h3>Web Development</h3>
          <p>I Started Programming with FORTRAN (Formula Translating System) in the time when IBM was using this language for programming their huge mainframe machines!  I continued with BASIC Language (Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code) and then COBOL Language (Common Business Oriented Language).  The simplicity of my second profession, i.e. Finance and Accounting, unfortunately spoiled me stay in this business for long time.  Finally, in 2012 I started looking back to my passionate for programming and Web Development as a career with more contemplation, creativity and the high speed of changes in technology. Since 2012 I switched my career as Web Developer and my scientific disire leading me to Research for Modern Technology.</p>
